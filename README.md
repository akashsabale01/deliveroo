## Setup

To run the app locally, you'll need to have Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install it globally using npm:

Copy code

    npm install -g expo-cli

Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

Copy code

    git clone https://github.com/akashsabale01/deliveroo.git
    cd deliveroo
    npm install

Finally, start the Expo development server:

Copy code

    expo start

This will open a Metro Bundler in your default web browser. From here, you can either run the app in an iOS or Android emulator, or on a physical device using the Expo client app.
